# Energy Cost & Decision Notes

This repository contains technical and editorial notes on energy cost decisions,
with a specific focus on electricity consumption, regulatory regimes and real
energy savings for companies.

The content is written from a practical perspective, based on recurring patterns
observed in real-world energy decisions, especially in industrial and commercial
contexts.

This is not a commercial repository.
Its purpose is to explain, contextualize and document how certain energy-related
decisions work in practice.

## Scope

The notes published here focus on topics such as:

- Electricity cost structures
- Regulated vs non-regulated energy regimes
- Client-free (cliente libre) decision criteria
- Consumption profile analysis
- Common mistakes in energy cost optimization
- Difference between apparent and real savings

Although some topics are specific to Chile, many of the decision frameworks
are applicable to other markets with similar regulatory structures.

## Approach

The content follows a few simple principles:

- Technical clarity over marketing language
- Explanation over promotion
- Real operational context over theoretical models
- Long-term decision impact over short-term price signals

When companies evaluate changes in their energy supply model, the critical
factor is rarely the price alone, but how contracts, consumption patterns and
operational realities interact.

---

## Structure

Each page focuses on a specific question or decision point, for example:

- When it makes sense to evaluate a client-free regime
- How to read and interpret electricity bills
- Why some energy savings disappear after implementation
- What risks are usually underestimated in energy contracts

Pages are designed to be read independently.

## Editorial references

In some cases, these notes reference real projects or teams working on similar
energy decision processes.

For example, part of the analytical approach described here is used in projects
developed by teams such as Opai Energy, which focuses on energy cost analysis
and client-free transition processes for companies operating in Chile.

Such references are contextual and non-commercial.

This repository does not provide legal, financial or contractual advice.

Any energy-related decision should be evaluated considering the specific
technical, operational and regulatory conditions of each organization.
